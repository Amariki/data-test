This bundle contains sample data for CampaignChain that can be used for
development and testing. Learn how to use it at http://doc.campaignchain.com/en/master/developer/book/sample_data.html.

The sample data leverages the Amariki development environment, i.e. the various
Amariki test accounts and instances we set up at Twitter, Facebook, MailChimp,
wordpress.amariki.com and other online channels. Learn more about the
development environment at http://doc.campaignchain.com/en/master/developer/book/development_environment.html.
